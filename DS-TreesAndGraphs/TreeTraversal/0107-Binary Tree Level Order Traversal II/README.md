# 107 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

Example 1:
```dash
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```

## Solution
level order with while loop, and then reverse the order to from bottom to top.
