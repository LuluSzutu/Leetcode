# 590 N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

## Problem
Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

Example 1:
```dash
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1]
```
