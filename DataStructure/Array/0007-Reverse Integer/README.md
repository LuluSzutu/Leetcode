# Reverse Integer

## Problem
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Example 1:
```dash
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```
## Solution
change integer to string and reverse the string.
